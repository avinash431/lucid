It's a truly pleasant experience to read this book, actually I should confess that I laughed A LOT in the reading. The book is hilarious.

Besides the fun part, I was inspired by this book too. This book went through the early history of Personal Computer industry, gave the vivid silhouettes of the people, the companies and Silicon Valley in this industry. Mr.Cringely examined why today's Information Technology industry is what it is now, and how it became like this.

The book provided the facts and opinion about how the high tech companies succeeded, and how many more failed. Why Bill Gates is the richest person in the world, and how Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the most beloved high tech company in the world.

It used to say that reading history can make people understand the rise and fall of things. We can learn the lessons from it, and get new ideas or patterns from the past success. Today Personal Computer is declining, and the focus is shifting to Smart Phone and Tablet. Although product is changing, the similar struggles, fights, winning and loss are still happening lively everyday in this industry, just like what it did in the old days.

Mr. Cringely presented a lot of insights in this book, many of them are still valid in these day. It's both informative and educational.

I recommended this book to anyone who is working for Information Technology industry and interested in how INTEL, Microsoft, Apple, Lotus and IBM this big names evolved into today's looking. This will benefit to the observers, thinkers, entrepreneurs and visionaries from both business and technology perspectives.

The only problem with this book is Mr. Cringely has many bias views about company or people, like IBM. He wrote this book in 1993 and updated it in 1996. Many views have been proved obsolete and wrong.

Accidental Empires by Robert Cringely, released in 1992, tells the story of an insider’s view of the rise of the personal computing era. The Rebooted edition was released online for free earlier this year. Find it here: http://www.cringely.com/2013/02/04/ac... (use the Next & Previous links at the top to change chapters). The individual stories are fascinating. Bill Gates always trying desperately to prove he could do anything (and in desperate need of a shower most of the time). Steve Jobs torpedoing the LISA project, which was his idea in the first place, and instead focusing on the Macintosh products (and also always in need of a shower). Don Estridge, who led IBM’s successful attempt to launch the first PC in 12 months, turning down Steve Jobs and a million dollar signing bonus and a million dollar annual salary to take essentially a demotion at IBM. The book looks at many different companies and projects and the people behind them from Apple to Atari. Some were successful, many weren’t. 
The history here seems to indicate that success can come against all odds. Those with vision and drive changed the world, even when they should have failed. Shoestring budgets and desperation led to many breakthroughs. Skunk work projects saved companies. At the same time very professional projects ended without any commercial success. Either there are no rules, or the rules are always changing. 
For me the best parts were about the famed research center Xerox PARC out of which came Ethernet, laser printers, the Alto workstation, and early graphical user interfaces. Apple borrowed heavily from their research, so did many of the other early pc companies. In part because many of the researchers left to turn their concepts into products. Much of what Xerox invented was actually based on work done by Doug Englebart at the Stanford Research Institute. When Doug Englebart passed away earlier this year the news credited him with inventing the computer mouse. In truth he envisioned most of our modern computing era, apparently by having a vision of much of our modern technology while driving to work one day in 1950. Doug Englebart and his team gave a demo of that computing vision in 1968 at the Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. This “mother of all demos” was described in this fashion by Robert Cringely: “the demo was equivalent to dropping-in on a model rocketry meeting and bringing with you a prototype warp drive. The world of computing was stunned.”
Xerox PARC didn’t bring much to market, but sure came up with some cool stuff. Since they were trying to go as fast as possible they used a flat organization. Everyone reported directly to Bob Taylor who was a psychologist, not an engineer. He knew he was capable of handling at most 40 to 50 researchers and 20 to 30 support staff. With this fixed number of researchers they sought to hire only the very best. Which they did and then turned them loose to create new stuff while Bob facilitated collaboration between work groups. The approach somehow worked well enough for them to implement tons of new technologies, even though it broke all the rules that we know of about successful organizations.
