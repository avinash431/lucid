Some question on Hive
a.       Difference between partitioning and bucketing
b.      When do you prefer bucketing over partitioning and vice-versa
c.       Based on what criteria you decide the number of buckets. Which number do you think is effective and efficient. Justify yourself.
d.      I have one table which is being loaded on hourly basis ie 24 files a day. The size of each file is 20KB. Which one you prefer out of bucketing & partitioning and justify?
e.      Consider the same as above, file size is 128 MB and input file size is 20 KB. 6 months data exists in table with 24 files/day. The files are stored in Parquet format. When hive query submitted on this table it is assigning a mapper for each file ie around 4500 mappers for 6 months data. I want to reduce the number of mappers as well as improve the performance of the query. What is your way of designing the table as well as hive query.
f.        The hive query is failing with out of memory errors. What could be the reason (just a guess) and do you propose any solution or alternative design to fix all the issues mentioned above.
g.       My requirement is to pull the data from CS3 DI hive table and perform complex transformations and finally load the transformed data into SQLServer. What is your design.
h.      File Formats: compare TEXT, SEQUENCE, AVRO, ORC & PARQUET file formats. Why do you think CS3 was designed to store data in Parquet format always. Do you see any advantages of Parquet files over other file formats.
i.         The column COMMENTS in source data has KEY:VALUE (JSON) format. For eg: “First Name”:”Ben”; “LastName”:”Sailor”; “company”:”Amex” etc. I want to split this column into multiple columns using hive query. Your solution.
j.        How do you implement incremental data loads with Hive. Your best design.
k.       I have skewed data that means not equally distributed. Which one you suggest for skewed data. Bucketing or Partitioning. Why?
l.         I have 2 tables. TAB1 has 500 GB data and TAB2 has 25MB data (lookup data).  Select a.1, b.2 from TAB1 a join TAB2 b on a.1=b.1 ; this query execution is taking time. Any suggestions to improve the performance of JOIN queries between these 2 tables.
m.    What is UDF. Tell me one UDF you implemented in hive.
n.      Special characters are coming in source data. Write a hive query to clean them up. Also I want to pick numbers alone from an alphanumeric value. How.
o.      Prepare hive functions like REGEX_REPLACE, MAP_TO_STR, REFLECT, DATE functions etc.
p.      How do you write DYNAMIC hive queries. Hint is to parameterize the hive query execution with hiveconf/hivevar and build the statements in wrapper script and pass them to hive variables.
q.      Current Hive version what we have does not support UPDATEs/DELETEs. Is there any workaround in hive to implement updates and deletes.
